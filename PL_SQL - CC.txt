1. Credit Limit - Functions-Programming constructs (2447)
Create a Function named 'credit_limit' which takes shipment entity id(i.e, entity_id) as input and returns the limit_status of type varchar. 
Function name : credit_limit 
Input Parameter : entity_id in int 
Output variable : limit_status variable of type varchar 
Design rules:  1) If the credit_limit of the given entity id is greater then 50000,then display the limit_status as 'Credit limit is greater than 50000'    
2) If the credit_limit of the given entity id is less then 50000,then display the limit_status as 'Credit limit is less than 50000' Note: DO NOT CHANGE the given status message in your solution.
Add / to the end of the query

create or replace function credit_limit
(
entity_id int
)
RETURN varchar
IS
limit_status varchar(255) := 'Credit limit is greater than 50000';
BEGIN
SELECT CASE
	WHEN credit_limit > 50000 THEN 'Credit limit is greater than 50000'
	ELSE 'Credit limit is less than 50000'
	END
INTO limit_status
FROM shipment_entity
WHERE id = entity_id;
RETURN limit_status;
END;
